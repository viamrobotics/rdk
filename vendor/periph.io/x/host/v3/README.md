## Example

Blink a LED:

~~~go
package main

import (
    "time"
    "periph.io/x/conn/v3/gpio"
    "periph.io/x/host/v3"
    "periph.io/x/host/v3/rpi"
)

func main() {
    host.Init()
    t := time.NewTicker(500 * time.Millisecond)
    for l := gpio.Low; ; l = !l {
        rpi.P1_33.Out(l)
        <-t.C
    }
}
~~~
