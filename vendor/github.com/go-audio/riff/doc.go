/*

Package riff is package implementing a simple Resource Interchange File Format
(RIFF) parser with basic support for sub formats such as WAV.
The goal of this package is to give all the tools needed for a developer
to implement parse any kind of file formats using the RIFF container format.

Support for PCM wav format was added so the headers are parsed, the duration and the raw sound data
of a wav file can be easily accessed (See the examples below) .
