# Dishcare Matrix Demo

## TODO
* James: package viam-server for jetson
* Eric/Fahmina: change cmd.go to log out matrix name, matrix, timestamp... forever
* Eric/Fahmina: get it running on jetson (but can develop on mac to start since this is a remote)
* Eric/Fahmina:: write instructions to download package, and provide them the config file from app.viam.com that we will set up for them in advance
    * on app.viam.com, make a robot config
    * move pi.json and jetson.json to app.viam.com
* Eric/Fahmina:: give instructions on how to use UI (probably use screenshots)
* Eric/Fahmina: write a brief overview on how the operation of cmd.go works so that they can easily adapt to however they'd prefer to ingest the above data
