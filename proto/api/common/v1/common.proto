  // ox, oy, oz, theta represents an orientation vector
  // Structured similarly to an angle axis, an orientation vector works differently. Rather than representing an orientation
  // with an arbitrary axis and a rotation around it from an origin, an orientation vector represents orientation
  // such that the ox/oy/oz components represent the point on the cartesian unit sphere at which your end effector is pointing
  // from the origin, and that unit vector forms an axis around which theta rotates. This means that incrementing/decrementing
  // theta will perform an in-line rotation of the end effector.
  // Theta is defined as rotation between two planes: the plane defined by the origin, the point (0,0,1), and the rx,ry,rz
  // point, and the plane defined by the origin, the rx,ry,rz point, and the new local Z axis. So if theta is kept at
  // zero as the north/south pole is circled, the Roll will correct itself to remain in-line.
  // Theta in pb.Pose should be degrees. It will be converted to radians in the internal OrientationVec.
