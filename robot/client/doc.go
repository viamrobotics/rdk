/*
Package client implements a Go client for the Viam RDK and can function as an SDK to connect to a robot.

# Install

To install the Go SDK, run

	go get go.viam.com/rdk/robot/client

# Basic Usage

The easiest way to get started writing a client application is to navigate to the robot page on app.viam.com,
select the CONNECT tab, and copy the boilerplate code from the section labeled Golang SDK.

It is recommended that you save and run this simple program. Doing so will ensure that the Golang SDK is
properly installed, that the viam-server instance on your robot is alive, and that the computer running
the program is able to connect to that instance.
