# TODO(APP-3043): Remove code owners
#
# This code owners is to make sure that the fleet team is aware
# of any changes that are going into RC while the team is updating
# the RC implementation in App.
#
# Code owners are no longer needed once RDK uses the shared,
# updated remote control cards from App. For any questions reach
# out to @ethanlook.
