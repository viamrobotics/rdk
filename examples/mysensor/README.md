# MySensor

This example demonstrates a user defining a new sensor model.


## How to add custom models

Models can be added to the viam-server by creating a struct that implements the interface of the API we want to register.
For example, if we want to create a sensor, we would want to make sure that we implement the Sensor interface, which includes the method `Readings` and also `DoCommand` from the `resource.Generic` interface.
The `resource.Generic` interface allows you to add arbitrary commands with arbitrary input arguments and return messages, which is useful if you want to extend the functionality of a model implementation beyond the API interface.

```
    type Sensor interface {
        resource.Resource
        // Readings return data specific to the type of sensor and can be of any type.
        Readings(ctx context.Context) (map[string]interface{}, error)
    }
```


The model then has to be registered through an init function, which should live in the package implementing the new model.
Init functions are run on import, so we have to make sure we are importing it somewhere in our code!

```
    // registering the component model on init is how we make sure the new model is picked up and usable.
    func init() {
        resource.RegisterComponent(
            sensor.API,
            resource.DefaultModelFamily.WithModel("mySensor"),
            resource.Registration[sensor.Sensor, *Config]{Constructor: func(
                ctx context.Context,
                deps resource.Dependencies,
                conf resource.Config,
                logger logging.Logger,
            ) (sensor.Sensor, error) {
                return newSensor(config.Name), nil
            }})
    }
```

In this case, since the model is implemented in the same file as the main package, we don't have to import the package anywhere.
But in other cases, we would have to import the package implementing the new model somewhere in the main package.
```
	// import the custom sensor package to register it properly. A blank import would run the init() function.

```

The `server` package can now be built then run (`go build -o main server/server.go` then `./main`) or run directly (`go run server/server.go`)

Check the custom sensor and server code out [here](https://github.com/viamrobotics/rdk/blob/main/examples/mysensor/server/server.go), and a simple client [here](https://github.com/viamrobotics/rdk/blob/main/examples/mysensor/client/client.go).

## Running the example

* Run the server implementing a new sensor `go run server/server.go`. Alternatively, you can build it by `go build -o main server/server.go`.
* Run the client `go run client/client.go`.

## Using the custom server as a remote

To use this custom server as part of a larger robot, youâ€™ll want to add it as a remote in the config for your main part.

```
    "remotes": [
        {
            "name": "my-custom-sensor",             // The name of the remote, can be anything
            "insecure": true,                       // Whether this connection should use SSL
            "address": "localhost:8081"             // The location of the remote robot
        }
    ]
```

And to ensure that the custom server starts up with the rest of the robot, you can run the custom server binary as a process as part of the robot config.

```
    "processes": [
        {
            "id": "0",
            "log": true,
            "name": "/home/pi/mysensor/main"
        }
    ]
```

NB: The viam-server starts as a root process, so you may need to switch users to run the custom server binary.

```
    "processes": [
        {
            "id": "0",
            "log": true,
            "name": "sudo",
            "args": [
                "-u",
                "pi",
                "/home/pi/mysensor/main"
            ]
        }
    ]
```
