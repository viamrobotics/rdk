// heavily inspired by https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/blob/main/internal/asyncwriter/async_writer.go

// NOTE: (Nick S)
// *Buffer is what powers camera.SubscribeRTP.
// It runs a single goroutine which pulls and runs callback functions
// in order published from a fixed capacity ringbuffer.
// When the ringbuffer's capacity is reached, `Publish` returns an error.
// This is important to maintain a bounded
// amount of queuing as stale video stream packets degrade video quality.

// One callback function is created & executed per RTP packet per subscribed client with the nuance that:
// (at time of writing) gostream is handling multiplexing from 1 track (a camera video feed) to N web
// browser peer connections interested in that track: https://github.com/viamrobotics/rdk/blob/main/gostream/webrtc_track.go#L126
// As a result, at time of writing, a *Buffer only ever has a single publisher and a single subscriber.

// NOTE: At time of writing github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib/v4/pkg/ringbuffer is not a ringbuffer (despite the name).
// It drops the newest data when full, not the oldest.
