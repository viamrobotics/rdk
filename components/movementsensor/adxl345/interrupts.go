From the data sheet:

In general, a good starting point is to set the Dur register to a value greater
than 0x10 (10 ms), the Latent register to a value greater than 0x10 (20 ms), the
Window register to a value greater than 0x40 (80 ms), and the ThreshTap register
to a value greater than 0x30 (3 g).
